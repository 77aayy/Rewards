# Workflow and Quality

## Before editing
- **Read before code**: Read the full function and ~30 lines around it before suggesting a change.
- **Scope check**: Ensure any variable used is in scope (avoid ReferenceError).
- **No guessing**: If context is missing, say "INSUFFICIENT CONTEXT - specify X" and do not build on assumptions.

## While editing
- **Update over create**: Modify existing code for consistency. Do not build from scratch unless explicitly requested.
- **Security**: Do not hardcode secrets (API keys, tokens). If found, warn immediately and suggest secure Firebase rules and dynamic config.

## After editing
- **Linter verification**: Do not say "no errors" without running read_lints on modified files.
- **Definition of done**: A task is not done until read_lints is clean, scope/context is verified, and user has confirmed any major logic change.

## Bugbot & PR Review Triggers
- **Run only on explicit trigger**: Do not run the bugbot debug workflow or full @cursor review unless the user comment contains one of:
  - `bugbot run`
  - `@cursor review`
- When invoked from a PR comment without these phrases, do not start instrumentation or debugging; respond according to the actual request only.

## Interaction
- **Language**: Code, comments, logs in English; replies and explanations in Arabic (Egyptian is fine).
- **Output**: Deliver working code. Explain "basics" only when there is a specific trick or technical reason.
